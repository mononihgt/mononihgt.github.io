## 本杰明巴顿奇事 

> citation "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"
> *   "For what it's  worth, it's never too late, ... or, in my case, too early,"
> 
> 	to be whoever you want to be.
>

> 	I hope you see things that startle you.
> 
> 	I hope you feel things you never felt before.
> 
> 	I hope you meet people with a different point of view.
> 
> 	I hope you live a life you're proud of.
> 
> 	And if you find that you're not, I hope you have the strength
> 
> 	to start all over again.
> 
> 	"... to start all over again."
> 
> 	
> 	
> * "You can be mad as a mad dog at the way things went.
> 
> 	You can swear and curse the Fates.
>

## 超脱

> citation "Detachment"
> * Whatever is on my mind, I say that's a feeling. I am truthful to myself. I'm young, and I'm old. I've been bought and I've been sold, so many times. I am hard to face, I am gone. I am just like you.
> 
> * I think a sense of humor is key. I don't possess it. hahaha...I mean, I do, in a tragic sort of way.
> 
> * your life will basically become a carnival of pain. Now when u can't stand it not one more day, not one more hour, it will get worse much worse. Every day I come into this office and I listen to you kids to shit all over yourselves. It's so easy to be careless, it takes courage and courage to care. None of you have any of these qualities.
> * These kids need something else,  they don't need me. 
> * You shouldn't be here, I'm not here. You may see me, but I'm hollow. 

## 怦然心动

> citation "Flipped"
> 
> * A cow by itself is just a cow.

> 	A meadow by itself is just grass, flowers.
> 
> 	And the sun peeking through the trees is just a beam of light.
> 
> 	But you put them all together and it can be magic.
> 
> * No, no, no, it's not fair. You can't condemn him for something he hasn't done.
> 
> * Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss. But every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent. And when you do, nothing will ever compare.

> 
> 
> 
> * They were careless people, Tom and Daisy.
> 
> 	They smashed up things and people...
> 
> 	and then retreated back into their money and their vast carelessness.
